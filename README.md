# Ironhack Project NLP

Team 4 (Salva, Diego, Fabi)

This project investigates different machine learning models for text classification. The goal is to classify headlines as either "Fake news" or "Real news".

## Files

* `training_data_lowercase.csv`: The dataset used for training and evaluating the models.
* `main.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the end result of our chosen model
* `train.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## Instructions

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open `main.ipynb` in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook.
3. Run the notebook cells to execute the code.

## Results

The results of the different models and preprocessing techniques are summarized in the notebook.

## Libraries

The following libraries are used in this project:

* re
* nltk
* numpy
* pandas
* matplotlib
* itertools
* sklearn

Make sure to install these libraries before running the code.
